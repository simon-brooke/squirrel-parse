# squirrel-parse

A Clojure library designed to parse SQL files into usable Clojure data structures, for automatic generation of things like [HugSQL](https://www.hugsql.org/) and [SQL Korma](http://sqlkorma.com/) (etc) boilerplate code.

## Usage

You can't use this yet. It doesn't work. When it does work it's likely that it will initially support only the bits of Postgres SQL that I habitually use; however I hope that it will be sufficiently adaptable that you can tailor it for your preferred variety of SQL.
